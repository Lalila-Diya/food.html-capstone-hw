        <h1>Tasty Food</h1>
        <p>Food can be described by its taste, such as sweet, sour, salty, or savory; its texture, like creamy, crunchy, chewy, or
        flaky; or its overall quality, such as delicious, bland, or rich. Describing food involves using adjectives to
        communicate the sensory experience, from how it smells and tastes to how it feels in your mouth.</p>

    <p>A steak is a thick slice of meat, typically beef, cut against the muscle fibers and cooked by grilling, frying, or
    broiling. It can also refer to other meats like fish or even non-meat items like mushrooms, but beef steak is the most
    common. Cooking steak properly involves choosing the right cut based on flavor and tenderness, seasoning it well, and
    cooking it to the desired internal temperature, such as rare, medium-rare, or well-done.<br>
<br>
        Ingredients<br>
        1 to 2 thick-cut steaks (1–1½ inches thick), such as ribeye or New York strip
        1 tbsp high-smoke-point oil, like vegetable, canola, or extra-light olive oil
        2–4 tbsp unsalted butter
        2 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly smashed
        2 sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme
        Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
